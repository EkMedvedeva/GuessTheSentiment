        "description": "Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action.\n\nIn No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\n\nNo Man's Sky, developed by Hello Games, was released in August 2016 after a highly anticipated marketing campaign that promised a groundbreaking, procedurally generated universe filled with exploration and discovery. The game's promotion created high expectations among gamers. However, at launch, the game faced significant criticism for missing key features that had been hinted at or promised during its development. Many players felt the game did not live up to its initial promises, leading to backlash and a wave of refund requests.\n\nOver time, however, Hello Games released multiple updates that addressed many of the criticisms, adding key features, which improved the game's reception. Today, No Man's Sky is often regarded as a success story of post-launch support and redemption in the gaming industry."
