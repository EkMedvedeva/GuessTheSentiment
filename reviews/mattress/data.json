The comfort foam adsorbs moisture and helps keep the sleep surface cool, providing you with a fresh and clean sleeping environment.\n\nCOOL & COMFORTABLE SLEEP: The queen memory foam mattress cover is made of high-quality knitted fabrics, providing superior comfort and durability. Knitted fabrics excel in great breathability and are soft-to-touch with enhanced air circulation for a cooler night's sleep.\n\nPRESSURE RELIEF & EDGE SUPPORT: The memory foam mattress offers a medium firmness sleep experience. Underneath the mattress cover lies a layer of comfort foam that conforms closely to the body's shape and relieves pain at pressure points. The supportive base generates enough pushback to provide excellent support to the body. The edge support on both sides of the mattress is reinforced to prevent slipping when sitting or sleeping near the edge.\n\nREMOVABLE WASHABLE MATTRESS COVER: Equipped with a high-quality zipper at the bottom of the mattress for easy removal of the cover. You can simply toss it into the washing machine for a quick and easy clean, protecting your mattress from stains and keeping the sleeping surface hygienic.\n\nWORRY-FREE PURCHASE: The queen mattresses come with a no-risk 100-night trial and a 10-year limited warranty.

We thought this was temporary fix but we are keeping them, just need to get platforms to place them on, not sure about that since they all seem to say the platform underneath isn't reliable.  But if you have the blow up bed and the teens all have this bed.... welp, they're teens, they can sleep on the blow mattress until YOUR own KING memory foam is delivered! LOL True story! Love this memory foam, never used it before, my whole body feels great, I think I was actually smiling in my sleep! We let the kids set it up its so easy!"

I saw there was a label says if it smell it's not harmful, so I tried to smell it but couldn't smell anything, I let it set in the basement for 2 days just to be safe anyway. It was easy to open, I did it myself with no help at all, it was wrapped pretty well with a long plastic cover. It feels good quality to touch, the price is pretty good compared to my $500 firm spring mattress that is 9 years old (nowadays good spring mattress can easily go 4 digits), this one is about the same price level with my the other 2 memory foam mattresses, only a bit better feel to touch in quality. All in all, it is a decent medium firm memory foam mattress for its affordable price."

One side is sitting at 10.5 and the other is a little under 10. Bed is super comfortable, but it\u2019s frustrating that I intentionally ordered a specific size due to my soft frame being low to the ground and now I need to spend additional money on a mattress topper to make the mattress 12\u201d."

This is very disappointing at the moment\n\n3 days in\u2026..one side is at full capacity and very firm. Very happy with this side. The other side is more firm than 2 days ago but still not the same as the other side.  Not sure why or how that works out but, much better.  If you sleep on your stomach any, this mattress is for you because no back pain after stomach sleeping for longer than anticipated.\n\nNo smell\nNice quality just not the firmness described\nValue for money good\nTook two of us to undo the roll there was so much plastic to keep it together.  Quite comically really the two of us"
