            <h2 class="about-title">About the Project and its Goals</h2>
            <p><b>The idea for this project emerged from a challenge faced with sentiment analysis models</b>. While these models provide valuable insights, they often struggle to accurately capture the true sentiment of real-world reviews due to <b>difficulties in interpreting words correctly within various contexts</b>. This can lead to misclassifications, as models may fail to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments depending on how words are used in specific situations.<br>The <b>goal of this project</b> is to <b>benchmark various sentiment analysis models</b> using <b>real user reviews</b>.<br>To achieve this, two types of analysis will be employed:<br>1) <b>Sentiment analysis models</b>, such as <b>Vader</b> and <b>TextBlob</b>,<br>2) <b>User-based evaluation of review scores</b>.<br>By comparing these approaches, <b>the project aims to identify which model is best suited for practical use</b>, ultimately providing more accurate and relevant sentiment insights.<br><i>*This project is currently in the development phase. At this stage, it focuses on a single scale and a corresponding question of the Net Promoter Score (NPS) type. In the future, additional scales and questions will be integrated into the project, allowing for a broader and more comprehensive evaluation of sentiment analysis models.</i></p>

            <h2 class="about-title">Contribution of the Project</h2>
            <p><b>This project aims to make a valuable social contribution</b> by providing insights that can guide both individual researchers and businesses in <b>selecting the most suitable sentiment analysis model</b> for their needs. <b>The results</b> of this research <b>will be shared on the project's website</b>, offering transparency and accessibility for those interested in understanding the performance of different sentiment analysis models.<br>In the future, based on the <b>outcomes of this research,</b> there is the potential to develop a <b>browser extension</b> designed to perform <b>sentiment analysis on product reviews from online marketplaces</b>. This extension would save users time by <b>automatically analyzing thousands of reviews, summarizing key information</b> about the product's advantages and disadvantages, and presenting it in an easily digestible format. This could revolutionize the way users make informed purchasing decisions, enhancing the shopping experience.</p>
